# Fitbit-Mental-Health-Watcher
My capstone project for Epicodus.  An application using the Fitbit smart watch to record sensor data and present it to the user.  The user can create an account so that their data is password protected.  Ideally it will have a React front end,  and use javaScript fitbit web API calls to get the users fitbit sensor data on a set time interval.  If the user clicks a start and stop button they can retrieve the sensor data from that chunk of time and view it in a user friendly format.  The goal is to allow people the ability to have more options to be mindful of times that they didn't like their mental state and be able to look back at what their body was doing during that time.
