# Fitbit-Mental-Health-Watcher
My capstone project for Epicodus.  An application using the Fitbit smart watch to record sensor data and present it to the user.  Ideally it will have a React front end,  and use javaScript fitbit web API calls to get the users fitbit sensor data on a set time interval.  If the user clicks a start and stop button they can retrieve the sensor data from that chunk of time and view it in a user friendly format.  The goal is to allow people the ability to have more options to be mindful of times that they didn't like their mental state and be able to look back at what their body was doing during that time.

#### Saturday, 02/19/2022

*6:30am-8am: spent 1.5 hours setting up a Fitbit developer account, setting up a Fitbit studio account, and exploring Fitbit.

*8am-9:15am: spent 1.25 hours using the fitbit studio documentation and  fitbit studio to create a watch app and export as well as a test project build with npx-fitbit in VS Code for testing.

*9:15am-9:45am: watch 2 part video series on accessing the fitbit web API via postman

*9:45am-11:15am: practice creating an authorization token for my fitbit and exploring endpoints for my profile data all in postman
