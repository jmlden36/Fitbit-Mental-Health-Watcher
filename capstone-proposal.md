Name of Project:  Fitbit Mental Health Watcher

Project's Purpose or Goal: It will allow a user to record Fitbit sensor data for a desired amount of time to observe their physical state while they are experiencing a panic attack or other potentially harmful mental states.  This data could allow someone to better understand the physical warning signs that could lead to the unwanted mental state or some data to send to their doctor or mental healthcare practitioner.  The goal is to make it very easy for a user to record this data.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: A user can connect their compatible Fitbit smart watch to the application via Bluetooth.  A user can see their watches sensor data on the app.  A user can save a snippet of their sensor data.
